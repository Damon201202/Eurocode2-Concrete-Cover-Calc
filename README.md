In each section of the calculator, you’ll need to enter specific project data:

Service Life: Enter the expected duration in years.

Exposure Class: Select the appropriate class (e.g., XC1, XC2).

Concrete Strength Class: Choose the class (e.g., C25/30, C30/37).

Bar Diameter: Specify the diameter of the largest longitudinal rebar.

Cement Type: Indicate whether the concrete is made with CEM I cement, without fly ash (FA).

Compact Cover Option: Applies to elements where good compaction of the concrete cover can be guaranteed (e.g., flat elements like slabs and ribbed floors cast horizontally on industrial or metal formwork).

For each field, refer to the "Notes" column in the calculator for guidance to ensure your input is correct and compliant with Eurocode 2 requirements. These inputs are essential for calculating both the minimum and nominal concrete cover values.

If you have questions or uncertainties, visit our dedicated page on concrete cover for detailed information and calculation examples.
