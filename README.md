## 📘 How to Use

To calculate the required cover, simply fill in the following project data:

- **Service Life** → Expected duration of the structure (in years).  
- **Exposure Class** → Environmental conditions (e.g., `XC1`, `XC2`, `XD1`, `XS3`, `XF1`, `XA2`).  
- **Concrete Strength Class** → Choose strength class (e.g., `C25/30`, `C30/37`).  
- **Bar Diameter** → Diameter of the largest longitudinal rebar.  
- **Cement Type** → Indicate if the concrete uses **CEM I without fly ash (FA)**.  
- **Compact Cover Option** → Applies when good compaction can be guaranteed  
  (e.g., slabs or ribbed floors cast horizontally on industrial/metal formwork).  

👉 For each parameter, refer to the **Notes** column inside the calculator for detailed guidance.  
These inputs are essential for calculating both **minimum** (`c_min`) and **nominal** (`c_nom`) cover values in compliance with Eurocode 2.
